    `This is Recode Media with Peter Kafka. 
     That’s me, I’m part of the Vox Media podcast network, 
     I’m speaking to you from Vox’s New York headquarters, 
     but I’m just going to be here for a minute, 
     because we’re going to go live, on tape, to Joe’s Pub. 
     This is a show I did this week. 
     We talked to Michael Barbaro, he’s the host of the New York Times’ mega hit podcast The Daily. 
     He’s great, the audience is really great, they loved hearing him. 
     You will like hearing from him too, so let’s go to Joe’s Pub right now.
     Who here listens to podcasts besides Recode Media? 
     Who listens to the New York Times The Daily podcast? 
     I have good news. 
     We have the host of The Daily’s podcast, Michael Barbaro. 
     Come on out, Michael. 
     Here he is.`
    ,
    `Hello. Hi Peter, thank you so much.`,
    `Sure, how are you?`,
    `I’m nervous. I mean, Samantha Bee? Cable TV?`,
    `I’m sorry. But we did tell you in advance.`,
    `I know.`
