# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1819

## Summary
This repository contains the podcast app that I made for Marie, and my research related to the app.

## 1. Installation

Fork and/or clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arash217/web-design-1819

And then open localhost:3000/index.html on your browser.

## Research

### User
Marie is deaf. She uses sign language to communicate with others. 
Some websites don't work properly for her, because she can't hear sound.
I was assigned to find a solution for her problem, so that she too can fully enjoy the web.

### User scenario
Marie wants to read the transcription of a podcast and understand the nuances(clapping in the background, jokes, etc.) in the podcast, that is most of the time lost, because of it not being added to the transcription.

### Exclusive Design Principles

#### Study Situation

#### Ignore Conventions

#### Prioritise Identity

#### Add Nonsense
