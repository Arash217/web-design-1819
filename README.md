## Research

### User
Marie is deaf. She uses sign language to communicate with others. 
Some websites don't work properly for her, because she can't hear sound.
I was assigned to find a solution for her problem, so that she too can fully enjoy the web.

### User scenario
Marie wants to read the transcription of a podcast and understand the nuances(clapping in the background, jokes, etc.) in the podcast, that is most of the time lost, because of it not being added to the transcription.

### Exclusive Design Principles

#### Study Situation
Observing Marie during the weekly review helped me to understand her problems, wishes and needs better.

#### Ignore Conventions
Since Marie is deaf, applying design patterns and/or conventions won't help me to solve her problems.
One convention that I did different, is, highlighting the spoken words in the transcript by their time.

#### Prioritise Identity
Marie playing an active role in the design process of the app helped me to prioritise her indentity in the app.
For example, I added her idea of having colours based on emotions to the tooltips.

#### Add Nonsense
Adding nonsense to go beyond the functional.
